9. University I
10. University J
11. University K
12. University L
13. University M

I kindly request your assistance in initiating the application process for these universities and any necessary guidance to ensure that I meet all the requirements and deadlines.

Furthermore, I am eager to explore opportunities for scholarships with a monthly stipend to support my studies. I would like to inquire about the eligibility criteria and application process for scholarships available at these universities. My academic credentials include an 8.51 CGPA in my undergraduate degree, 71% in 12th standard, and 88% in 10th standard. Currently, I am employed as a Software Developer at an MNC company.

If there are any additional details or documents needed to strengthen my scholarship applications, please do let me know, and I will promptly provide the required information.

Your guidance and assistance in this matter are highly valuable to me, and I am grateful for your support throughout this process. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
